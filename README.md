# Bell regression model for mortality modeling

In this project you will find all the material that I used in the _Bell regression model_ workshop at CEDEPLAR.

You can find more information about the Bell distribution in [this post](https://scpatricio.github.io/bell/) I wrote, and about the regression model associated with that distribution in [this post](https://scpatricio.github.io/bell_reg/).
