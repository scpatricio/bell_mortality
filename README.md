# Bell regression model for mortality modeling

In this project you will find all the material that I used in the _Bell regression model_ workshop at CEDEPLAR.

You can find more information about the Bell distribution in [this post](https://scpatricio.github.io/bell/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} I wrote, and about the regression model associated with that distribution in [this post](https://scpatricio.github.io/bell_reg/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
